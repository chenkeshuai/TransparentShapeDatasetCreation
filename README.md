# Transparent Shape Dataset Creation

This repository contains the code to create the transparent shape dataset in paper [Through the Looking Glass: Neural 3D Reconstruction of Transparent Shapes, CVPR 2020](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~viscomp/projects/CVPR20Transparent/). Please check our [webpage](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~viscomp/projects/CVPR20Transparent/) for more information. Please consider citing our paper if you find this code useful. 

## Overview 
We create transparent shape dataset by procedurally combining shape primitives to create complex sceenes. An overview of our dataset creation pipeline is shown below. Please refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10904) for more details. 

## Prerequsites 
In order to run the code, you will need to prepare:
